# Magic 8 Ball

## Goal

The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills learned in the Dicee tutorial and make an app with functionality. There’s no new concepts here. Project based learning is the best way to learn a new skill and this project is no exception.

## What I created

I made a Magic 8 Ball app. You can ask the app to make all your hard decisions! With this app in your pocket, you’ll always have an answer to life’s many conundrums!
